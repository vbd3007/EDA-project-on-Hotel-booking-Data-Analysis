# EDA-project-on-Hotel-booking-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding and deriving insights from hotel booking data. It involves the process of summarizing key characteristics, visualizing data, and identifying patterns, anomalies, and potential relationships within the dataset. Here's an overview of the steps and key considerations for conducting EDA on hotel booking data:

**1. Data Collection and Inspection:**
   - Gather the hotel booking dataset, which may include information on bookings, guests, rooms, prices, dates, and more.
   - Inspect the dataset to understand its structure, the types of variables (numerical, categorical, date-time), and check for missing values.

**2. Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing data by imputing or removing them based on the context.
   - Check for duplicates and remove them if necessary.
   - Correct any data inconsistencies or errors.

**3. Data Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations to gain insights into the dataset. Some common plots and charts include:
     - Histograms and density plots to understand the distribution of numerical variables like room prices and booking duration.
     - Bar charts for categorical variables like room types or meal plans.
     - Time series plots to analyze booking trends over time.
     - Box plots to identify outliers in numerical variables.
     - Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables (e.g., price vs. booking duration).

**4. Summary Statistics:**
   - Calculate and analyze summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical variables.
   - Calculate frequency counts and proportions for categorical variables.

**5. Data Relationships:**
   - Explore relationships between variables. For example:
     - Does the day of the week influence booking rates?
     - Are there seasonal trends in hotel bookings?
     - Are there correlations between room type and booking duration?

**6. Outlier Detection:**
   - Identify and investigate outliers that may indicate data anomalies or interesting patterns.
   - Determine whether outliers should be treated or kept for analysis.

**7. Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features if they can provide valuable insights. For example:
     - Calculate the lead time between booking and check-in dates.
     - Create a binary variable indicating whether a booking was canceled.

**8. Hypothesis Testing:**
   - If applicable, conduct hypothesis tests to assess relationships or differences between variables. For example:
     - Test whether there is a significant difference in room prices between weekdays and weekends.
     - Evaluate whether booking cancellations are associated with certain guest characteristics.

**9. Geospatial Analysis (if applicable):**
   - If the dataset includes location data, consider geospatial analysis to understand spatial patterns, such as the popularity of hotels in different regions.

**10. Data Insights and Reporting:**
    - Summarize key findings and insights from the EDA process.
    - Visualize important trends, correlations, and patterns.
    - Communicate results through reports or presentations.

**11. Further Analysis:**
    - Depending on the initial findings, you may choose to perform more advanced analyses, such as predictive modeling or segmentation, to gain deeper insights or support decision-making.

Remember that the specific steps and analyses in your EDA will depend on the nature of the hotel booking dataset and the questions you want to answer. EDA serves as a foundation for more in-depth analysis and helps in making data-driven decisions related to hotel operations, pricing strategies, and guest experiences.
